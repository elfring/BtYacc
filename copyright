Upstream Authors:

  (Original author of Berkeley byacc - NB btyacc is based on an older

Copyright:

The original byacc code carries the following license:

  Berkeley Yacc is distributed with no warranty whatever. The code is
  certain to contain errors. Neither the author nor any contributor
  takes responsibility for any consequences of its use.

  Berkeley Yacc is in the public domain. The data structures and
  algorithms used in Berkeley Yacc are all either taken from documents
  available to the general public or are inventions of the author. 
  Anyone may freely distribute source or binary forms of Berkeley Yacc
  whether unchanged or modified. Distributers may charge whatever fees
  they can obtain for Berkeley Yacc. Programs generated by Berkeley
  Yacc may be distributed freely.

Initial changes by Chris Dodd:

  BTYACC was created by Chris Dodd using ideas from many places and
  lots of code from the Berkeley Yacc distribution, which is a public
  domain yacc clone put together by the good folks at Berkeley. This
  code is distributed with NO WARRANTEE and is public domain. It is
  certain to contain bugs, which you should report to:
  chrisd@collins.com.

Further license notice by Chris Dodd and Vadim Maslov:

  In English: BtYacc is freeware. BtYacc is distributed with no
  warranty whatsoever. The author and any other contributors take no
  responsibility for any and all consequences of its use.

  In Legalese: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NEITHER SIBER SYSTEMS NOR ANY
  OF ITS LICENSORS NOR ANY BTYACC CONTRIBUTOR SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY
  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES
  FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, CAUSED BY BTYACC AND
  INCURRED BY CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN
  CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF SIBER SYSTEMS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Because of the unclear meaning of the term "Freeware", I (Richard
Atterer) contacted the contributors by mail and asked them to clarify
its meaning. Statement by Chris Dodd:

> All of my changes to Berkeley Yacc in making btyacc are public
> domain, as is the original byacc. I did that originally as I was
> unable to maintain btyacc, and wanted to make it widely available to
> anyone who could. I beleive there's actaully a statement to this
> effect in the top of the readme file.

Statement by Vadim Maslov:

> BtYacc is free in the freest sense of a word. Modification,
> imporvement, commercial use -- all this is possible.
>
> It is free in the same sense as original Berkeley Yacc, so it is
> freer than GNU yacc -- you can use it in commercial systems, I
> myself use it in CobolTransformer that is licensed for a lot of
> money.
>
[snip]
> BtYacc, just like Byacc is hereby officially donated to public
> domain. And as I understand, Chris Dodd agrees with me.
