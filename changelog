btyacc (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Security bugfix: Switched to mkstemp() instead of mktemp(),
    temporary files are unlink()ed immediately after creation
  * Added parser skeleton /usr/doc/btyacc/examples/btyacc-c.ske.gz
    which compiles both as C and C++
  * Applied some compatibility fixes by Mitchell Charity, made
    "usage:" message more verbose, made "skel2c" build script work
    with all awks, not just gawk
